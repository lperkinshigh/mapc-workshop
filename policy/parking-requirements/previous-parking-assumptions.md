# Previous Parking Assumptions

### Retrofitting Suburbia

* We assumed all parking spaces consumed 400 square feet of parcel area, including both the space itself and area needed for car navigation through the parking lot.
* The number of parking spaces required per housing unit on the parcel is determined based on the number of jobs within 45 minutes by transit \(Owen and Murphy, 2020\) and the findings of MAPC’s Perfect Fit Parking research report \(MAPC, 2019\). In areas with less than 500 jobs within 45 minutes by transit, 1.5 spaces are required per dwelling unit. In areas with 501 – 50,000 jobs within 45 minutes by transit, 1 space is required per dwelling unit. In areas with 50,001 – 99,999 jobs within 45 minutes by transit, 0.75 spaces are required per dwelling unit. Lastly, 0.5 spaces are required per dwelling unit in areas with 100,000 or more jobs within 45 minutes by transit.
