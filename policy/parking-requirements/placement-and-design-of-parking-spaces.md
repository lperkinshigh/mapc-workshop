## Lot, Vehicle, and Location Restrictions

* No accessory off-street parking space shall be permitted within the required front yard in any R District, except that this shall not be construed as applying to parking required for a one- or two-family dwelling.
* "Piggy-back" parking, in which each space does not have independent access to a driveway or street, is not allowed, except when such spaces are permanently assigned to the same residential unit and except for one- and two-family homes.

## Design Requirements

* Standard parking spaces. Each parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and 18 feet in length. Aisle width shall be a minimum of 18 feet for one-way traffic and 24 feet for two-way traffic.
* No portion of any entrance or exit driveway shall be closer than 20 feet to the curb of an intersecting street.
